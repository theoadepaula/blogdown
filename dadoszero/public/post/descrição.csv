25 Words or Less;"Players divide up into two teams.  The current clue-givers look at a list of five words that they're going to have to get their teammates to say using only words (aka, no sounds or gestures).  The clue-givers bid on the number of words that they can accomplish the feat, with the lowest bid getting the honor of doing so.  If the team cannot successfully name the words in the allotted time and with the bid number of words (or less), then the other team gets the point.  The first team to collect ten points is the winner.&#10;&#10;Won Games Magazine Game of the Year award in 1997.&#10;&#10;";Party Game,Word Game;1996

French Foreign Legion;"(from the back of the box:)&#10;&#10;The French Foreign Legion is based on a genre of movies and serials that feature hard-cased Legionnaires defending a desert fort against hordes of fanatical tribesmen. The action is fast, furious, and unpredictable as the Bedouins rush the walls, throw their grappling hooks, and climb up for furious melees with the tough defenders. Can the walls be held, or is it time to fall back to the inner buildings? Will dynamite breach the walls, and will the heat cause men to be seized by &quot;the madness&quot;? What about the mutiny that was brewing? Can the discipline and strong defenses stop overwhelming numbers?

Scrabble Sentence Cube Game;"Players in turn roll the 21 word cubes, set the timer and form sentences with the words appearing on the tops of the cubes in a crossword puzzle-like fashion (one word may be part of two sentences - one running vertically and one running horizontally). Turns end when the egg timer runs out. Players score 50 points for each sentence of 7 words or more. All other sentences score the square of the number of words in the sentence (i.e. a 4-word sentence scores 4 X 4, or 16 points). A bonus of 50 points is awarded if all 21 cubes are used. Two points are deducted for each unused cube.&#10;&#10;The 1983 version of the game seems to differ in the number of cubes.  The rules on the inside of the box lid still have a 1971 copyright date, but among other differences, they state that the game contains 27 cubes.  Two of the new cubes are marked with stars on all six sides, making them wild.  From the 1983 rules: &quot;When playing a wild cube, a player must state what word it represents, after which it cannot be changed during that turn.&quot;&#10;&#10;The 1988 version has 24 cubes - two of which are the starred wild dice. The box states that this is the 2nd edition of the game from Coleco Games. Selchow &amp; Righter is credited in the directions as a subsidiary of Coleco Industries, Inc. The majority of the outer box is blue.&#10;&#10;";Dice,Word Game;1971
Piecepack;"Piecepack is to board games what a Standard Deck of Playing Cards is to card games. It is a set of components that can be used to play many games. Included in each set are tiles to build the board, allowing for boards of various shapes and sizes, coins in varying suits and values, dice in suits and values, and player pawns.&#10;&#10;See Piecepack Game System for a detailed look at the system and its games.&#10;&#10;Thus far, over 100 games have been developed for piecepack sets, and since it is an open-source type system, new games appear frequently.&#10;&#10;The other interesting thing is that piecepack sets are public domain. Anyone can make one, even for profit, without paying any sort of royalties of any kind.  It is generally requested that they conform to some standard dimensions, but otherwise, they are free to make and sell.&#10;&#10;The suggested Piecepack dimensions make them compatible with Looney Pyramids.&#10;&#10;";Game System;2001

The other players attempt to guess how that player will answer.  Points are awarded for guessing correctly.

88;"(from the game box:)&#10;&#10;88 is an intense tactical-level game of ground combat in Africa's Western Desert in World War II, the famous struggle between the British &quot;Desert Rats&quot; and the German and Italian Afrika Korps. 88 duplicates the strengths and weaknesses of the German, British and Italian units involved with 50 data cards that display all the information needed to move and fight. The game system, shared with our earlier popular Panzer game (which covers battles on the Eastern Front), easily incorporates myriad details such as armor thicknesses at various points, shots from various angles, heights, and altitudes, and the effects of terrain. The rules cover the important aspects of small unit tactics - armor piercing shots, small arms fire, high explosives, artillery barrages, air support, communications, turret rotation, gun depression, mines, roadblocks, barbed wire, smoke, and much more. The flexible scenarios cover a variety of combat situations that are resolved on the six-piece geomorphic mapboard, which also features movable terrain pieces. The types of units include infantry, anti-tanks guns (including the deadly 88mm), Matildas, Crusaders, Bren Carriers, Long Range Desert Group Trucks, Honeys, Grants, Shermans, M13/40s SEM 41s, a large variety of Pz IIIs and IVs, halftracks, and much, much more.&#10;&#10;";Wargame,World War II;1980
The Sword and the Flame;"&quot;Being a set of introductory rules for the conduct of miniature battles of the British Empire&quot;&#10;&#10;This one set of rules enables the miniature wargamer to play in six different Colonial periods - Pathans 1878, Zulus 1879, Boers 1880, Egyptians 1882, Dervishes 1884 and African Exploration (only in the 20th Anniversary Edition). There is no need for additional supplements or game cards.&#10;&#10;By utilizing half-a-dozen or so six-sided dice (d6), about a dozen 10-sided dice (d10), a tape-measure and a standard set of playing cards, this was the first published set of rules to incorporate:&#10;&#10;- Variable move distance&#10;    - Specific casualty determination&#10;    - Random movement and firing sequence&#10;&#10;Figures are individually mounted, but movement, morale and combat is by the unit, with the basic unit being the 20 figures infantry platoon (or Pathan clan, Zulu Iviyo, Dervish warband), 12 figures for a cavalry troop and 4 figures for an artillery battery. Units are then added to make larger forces (company, battalion, Pathan/Dervish tribe, Zulu Ibutho, Boer Commando, and cavalry squadron). Each unit has an identifiable command figure.&#10;&#10;TSATF has been described as a semi-skirmish game. Unit movement is determined by die roll, different types of units under different circumstances rolling differing numbers of six-sided dice. Random card draws decide which units move first, and also determine the effects of fire and combat.&#10;&#10;&quot;The Sword and the Flame 20th Anniversary Edition&quot;&#10;Included in the updated 20th Anniversary Edition are many new features such as Pinning defenders, Two ranks firing, Overhead fire, Pass-through fire, Limited ammunition, Volley and independent fire, and a Rules synopsis page. The 20th Anniversary Edition is an improvement over the original edition.&#10;&#10;The Sword and the Flame is designed for use with 25mm figures, but it can be easily suited for 15mm and 20mm miniatures.&#10;&#10;";Miniatures,Wargame;1979

Pro Tennis;"Pro Tennis simulates tennis matches in the early 1980's, the era of Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe, Martina Navritolova and Chris Evert. Included are cards for 50 men and 50 women professionals. Each card has a column for &quot;Serve&quot;, &quot;Serve Return&quot;, &quot;Volley&quot; and &quot;Special&quot;. Play consists of rolling dice (two white dice, plus a red die that isn't added to the others but sometimes changes the outcome) and cross-indexing the number rolled with the proper column. The result will be a point for one of the players or an instruction to roll next in one of the other columns. Once in a while, a player gets to make a choice that varies a column's results, and random events, such as stomach cramps, broken rackets, arguments with the umpire and thunderstorms, are possible.&#10;&#10;To take an example, Connors is pitted against McEnroe. Connors has the serve. He rolls 1, 5 (white) and 3 (red). The dice roll is 15 (read the dice as digits, low roll first); the red is ignored unless it's a 5 or 6. A 15 in Connors' Serve column is &quot;I&quot;, which means that McEnroe can return the serve. He rolls 2, 2 (white) and 1 (red) - a 22, which yields a &quot;V&quot; in his Serve Return column. Connors must now roll against his Volley column. He gets 4, 6 (white) and 5 (red). Ordinarily, a 46 would be a point for him, but the red 5 allows McEnroe to make a clutch return. He rolls the white dice (only). A score equal to or less than his Clutch Value is a V result; anything higher loses the point. McEnroe's Clutch Rating is 33. He rolls a 3 and a 6 - not good enough, and Connors is ahead 15-love.&#10;&#10;Connors serves again: 4, 6 (white) and 5 (red). An ace for Connors; McEnroe doesn't even get a clutch return. 30-love.&#10;&#10;The next Connors serve: 2, 2 (white) and 2 (red). Triples generate a random event. (Many players think that random events are too common and limit their appearance to rolls of triple 1's.) Connors rolls the two white dice: 3, 4. He's gotten into an argument with the umpire (realism!) and draws a warning. If he argues again, he'll automatically lose a point.&#10;&#10;Back to serving: 1, 4 (white) and 2 (red). The result is &quot;I&quot;. McEnroe's return: 3, 4 (white) and 1 (red) - a &quot;V&quot;. Connors rolls 1, 2 (white) and 4 (red). A 12 on his Volley column is &quot;S&quot;, which means that he returned the shot but left his opponent in a good position. McEnroe can roll on the favorable &quot;Special&quot; column. Sure enough. He rolls 3, 5 (white) and 3 (red); a 35 on his Special column wins the point. 30-15.&#10;&#10;And so it goes.&#10;&#10;This not a game for anyone who wants to devise winning strategies. Rather, the players watch as the dice play. That is, however, the point of this kind of sports simulation: to project what would happen if real athletes competed in imaginary matches.&#10;&#10;The game also includes rules for doubles, mixed doubles and matches between men and women.&#10;&#10;";Sports;1983
Fear God and Dread Nought;"Fear God &amp; Dread Nought completes the Admirality Trilogy (Harpoon 4, Command at Sea, Fear God &amp; Dread Nought) Utilizing the same framework, those familiar with either of the other games will have no difficulty stepping into the First World War. The selection of a small scenario allows the novice to play within an hour of opening the box, with several scenarios also being optimal for solitaire play.&#10;&#10;Rules come punched for a three ringed binder (not provided) for ease of use and photocopying. They follow the same format as our other rules used in the Trilogy, making them easy to follow for experienced gamers, and novices alike. Tactical turns represent 3 minutes, with intermediate turns (for long distance maneuvering and long stern chases) representing 30 minutes. Gun hit probability is based upon a combination of factors such as visibility, range, target size, number of rounds firing at the target, and speeds of the firing and target platforms. Damage is a function of the type of shell, number of barrels firing and armor of target, and is easy to calculate also. Blank ship forms allow the player to list all the ranges and damages of his ship's particular guns in advance, making it quick and easy to calculate both damage and hit probability. Critical damage is a function of the amount of damage taken last round vs. the amount of damage able to be taken. Critical hits typically scored against systems (engineering, bridge, steering or individual weapon amounts).&#10;&#10;The 40+ scenarios include the well known &quot;biggies&quot; such as Jutland (broken into three parts, as well as the grand battle) and Dogger Bank, and many smaller engagements. Often there are variants given, covering important &quot;almosts&quot; and &quot;what ifs&quot;. All aspects are covered, with ships provided for the Japanese, Turkish, Austrian, and Russian navies as well as the British and German fleets. The Data Annex includes all ship classes for the war and is a valuable reference by itself. So with this product, one need only Fear God &amp; Dread Nought!&#10;&#10;";Miniatures,Nautical,Wargame,World War I;2001
GOLO;"GOLO Golf dice is played with 9 12-sided dice that represent the 9 holes on the front (or the back) of an 18-hole traditional golf course. There are 5 white dice (par 4s), 2 red dice (par 3's) and 2 blue dice (par 5s). Each dice has the ability to shoot above par, par, or below par. There are as many formats as there are golf side games, but players typically play in one of two formats:&#10;&#10;Traditional Format:&#10;&#10;All nine dice are rolled--the player chooses at least 1 die, but can use more than one to count toward his/her 9-hole total. The remaining dice are picked up and rolled again. Players have the option of having multiple dice count toward their score, or choose as few as one and try to &quot;GO LO&quot; (shoot a low score--golf parlance).&#10;&#10;Golf Course Format:&#10;&#10;In this format, the players must follow along to the scorecard of their favorite course, or any course. If the first 9 holes (&quot;Front 9&quot;) at Pebble Beach are laid out in this order--4-4-3-4-5-3-4-4-5=36, then when the player begins by rolling all 9 dice, he/she must play the course &quot;in order&quot; by choosing two par 4's before he/she may then chose a par 3. Having to go in the order of holes on a golf course creates a different strategy and usually produces higher scores than the Traditional format.&#10;&#10;In all formats, tournament play is the most exciting--where players are playing against each other, and their scores are affecting other players' choices and strategies.&#10;&#10;A game primarily for non-gamers and sports nuts, which nevertheless is a very strategic, &quot;push-your-luck&quot; dice game. It is not just a matter of rolling dice and counting up your score; the requirement of keeping one or more dice each time you roll presents many interesting choices, depending on what your opponent has done, and what you already have kept for scoring.&#10;&#10;The game is sold online at www.igolo.com and in major golf shops and golf stores. Game includes a cup, nine dice, score pad, pencil, and rulebook.&#10;&#10;";Dice,Sports;1999

Units are regiments of 15 to 30 figures divided into 5 bases, with players commanding a division or corps.&#10;&#10;The first edition was published by Adventure Games in 1983.

Electronic Catch Phrase: Music Edition;"An electronic music version of the trivia board game.  Two teams sit in such a way that they are in between two of their opponents and facing everyone.  The game is much like Hot Potato; a song and artist appears on the screen of the handheld device.  The player currently holding it must get one of their teammates to correctly guess the name of the song.  They must do this without saying any part of a word on the screen, rhyming any parts of those words, or saying the first letter of any of those words.  When a teammate guesses correctly, the device is passed to the left for the other team to do the same.  The round ends when an internal timer runs out and a buzzer sounds.  The team not holding the device at that time scores a point.&#10;&#10;There are two ways to play, and scoring is different in each.  The first is similar to classic Catch Phrase.  However, if you wish to incorporate singing into the game, the other version adds an extra point for any clue that is sung, if the team guesses correctly.&#10;&#10;The game has 9 categories to choose from each round: Pop Mix, 70s, 80s 90s, 2000s, Classic Rock, Hip Hop/R&amp;B, Country, Oldies.&#10;&#10;The game requires 3 AAA batteries, not included.&#10;&#10;";Electronic,Music,Party Game,Trivia;2007

Iron and Oak;"Iron and Oak is game of ship-to-ship combat set during the American Civil War. As a tactical representation of naval warfare, each of the ships is accurately modeled for offensive capability including gunnery, ramming and spar torpedoes; for defensive capability including damage and five distinct armored or wooden hit locations; and for maneuverability, crew size and draft.&#10;&#10;You command 70 famous ships of the era, including the Union: Onondaga, Tecumseh, Winnebago, Monitor, Osage, Minnesota, Brooklyn, Hartford, Essex, Carondolet, Kearsarge, Ossipee, Queen of the West, Iroquois, Spuyten Duyvil; and the Confederate: Tennessee, Virginia, Atlanta, Palmetto State, Arkansas, Albemarle, Alabama, Florida, General Beauregard, Sumter; and many more.&#10;&#10;Many of the 14 scenarios, in this easy-to-learn game, are playable in an hour or less. Included are 13 historical and 1 hypothetical engagements featuring Hampton Roads, Mobile Bay, Trent&rsquo;s Reach, Wassaw Sound, the duel between Alabama and the Kearsarge, and the saga of the Arkansas, which may be played as three individual scenarios or as a linked mini-campaign.&#10;&#10;In addition, forts bristling with guns make their appearance to challenge the will of the ship captains. If that was not enough to heat things up, scenario based optional rules add a few interesting &lsquo;what if&rsquo; situations to expand on play.&#10;&#10;If you are interested in commanding your own fleet, Iron and Oak includes a standalone campaign module where player selected forces fight it out in the many rivers, bays, inlets and costal areas. The campaign game recreates the brown water actions, typical of the period, in a series of randomly generated battles. As play progresses, the players do not know the exact length of the campaign or the specific mix of the battles. Players must not only manage the unfolding battles, but must also strategically allocate resources and repair and refits their ships. The 16 card Navy Yard deck is used to plot a course through and influence the challenges of the campaigns.&#10;&#10;Two or more players battle it out on an 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; map that features an area movement grid. This simple approach controls ship movement as well as all combat action. Gone are the long periods of inaction, typical of ACW tactical naval games, as these early steam-era ships struggled to maneuver into battle.&#10;&#10;This innovative game system places the emphasis on quick action and tactical decision making. The 50 Action Cards are used to assist and enhance play, not drive it. Each time you battle it out, whether in a scenario or campaign game, the action unfolds in a very different manner. Do you wish to employ hot shot or incendiary shells? Is now the best time to rapid fire or is it wise to maneuver and ram? Should you allocate part of the crew as a repair party? Is that enemy ship going to maneuver into your torpedo (mine) field? These and many other possibilities exist through the play of the action cards. Or, you may decide to not play any action cards at all and just maneuver and shoot. You control how and when the action will unfold.&#10;&#10;At its core Iron and Oak is a naval simulation. It accurately models the close-range slugging matches typical of the period. You have the opportunity to play out the various battles to their conclusion. Will history repeat itself, or will a new account be written? Will the Monitor&rsquo;s 11&rdquo; Dahlgren smoothbores blast through Virginia&rsquo;s armor plating or will their battle again end in a stalemate? Will the powerful Tennessee win out against Admiral David Farragut&rsquo;s Union fleet or again fall to his superior numbers? Will the Atlanta defeat the two Union monitors in kind or again slip aground and strike her colors. This time, you get to determine the outcome. You are not bound by history&rsquo;s stories.&#10;&#10;";American Civil War,Civil War,Nautical,Wargame;2013

The player will manage a small force of roughly a dozen units as he tries to complete some specific mission assigned to him, such as &ldquo;Hold the village and our bridgehead at all costs!&rdquo; or: &ldquo;Drive the French from Plancenoit!&rdquo;&#10;&#10;From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;Lasalle is ideal for a small gaming table, and it plays in real-time with most battles lasting 2-3 hours. It is perfect for pick-up games or tournament play. It therefore includes sample army lists enabling players to collect and paint typical small forces from a large number of possible nationalities.&#10;&#10;If you have a club, or a larger collection and gaming area, Lasalle can also be used to simulate historical battles of the Napoleonic Wars, such as Quatre Bras, Albuera, Saalfeld, or Eggm&uuml;hl.

Kings of War is a challenging game of strategy, where you can pit your wits against your opponent without devoting half of your brain power to remember a plethora of convoluted rules.&#10;&#10;And that&rsquo;s not all, the innovative turn structure allows you to play Kings of War using a time-keeping tool (like a stopwatch or a chess clock) to time your moves. As the seconds tick away, the pressure and excitement this adds makes 'Kings of War' unlike any other large-scale wargame you&rsquo;ve ever played before.&#10;&#10;Units are given simple ratings such as 'Melee Attack', 'Defense' and 'Nerve' and then augmented with special abilities that characterize the different fantasy races that inhabit the world. In 2015, the &quot;beta&quot; rules were updated and a full ruleset was released. Abbreviated rules are downloadable from Mantic's website, and extracts (about 70%) from the full army lists for all factions are also available for download, called &quot;starter lists&quot;. Currently army lists exist for Elves, Dwarves, Kingdoms of Men (medieval humans), Basileans (clerical army with saints and angels), Forces of Nature (Treemen, Dryads and other assorted forest creatures), Forces of the Abyss (devils and demons), Abyssal (evil) Dwarves, Goblins, Orcs, Ogres, Twilight Kin (evil elves) and the Undead hordes. &#10;Additional factions lists are now available in the &quot;Uncharted Empires&quot; supplement: The Brotherhood (high medieval and mystical humans with elementals), Salamander (humanoid lizards), The Herd (satyrs... ok: beast-men), The League of Rhordia (fantasy renaissance humans and halflings), The Trident Realms of Neritica (tritons/ fishmen), The Empire of Dust (aegyptian undead... yes, kings from tombs), Night-Stalker Armies (spirits, ghosts and the like), Ratkin Armies (ska... er, scavenger ratmen) and the Varangur (chao...tic warriors).&#10;&#10;";Book,Fantasy,Miniatures,Wargame;2010
Dystopian Wars;"The year is 1870.&#10;The World is at War.&#10;&#10;The world of Dystopian Wars is similar to our own, but subtly different. The year is 1870 and the Industrial Revolution occurred decades earlier than in our own world. Technology is far advanced, and in many cases, unrecognisable, which has led to the development of fantastic naval vessels, hulking land ships and terror from the skies in the form of airships and war balloons.&#10;&#10;Dystopian Wars is designed to ensure a fun game with a large selection of models in a couple of hours. We are big fans of Steam Punk and Victoriana, so we jumped at the chance of creating a naval warfare game along similar lines to our Uncharted Seas and Firestorm Armada games - but encapsulating these interesting genres. Dystopian Wars incorporates Naval, Aerial and Land Models from the outset, so that you can set up battles and scenarios in any combat setting. Games can be played in each genre of warfare OR using a combination of ALL models.&#10;&#10;Spartan Games will supply highly detailed, high quality resin and metal miniatures with which you can roam the high seas, scour the smog filled skies of Dystopian Wars for enemy flying ships, or doggedly defend the cities and countryside of your home nation. These three branches of the military use the same core rules for movement and combat, with varying abilities and statistics.&#10;&#10;Our fast play rules are optimised for large fleet actions, so you can get as many miniatures on the table as you want, and still get an enjoyable game in one evening. Dystopian Wars is also ideal for multiplayer games, because you get to activate individual squadrons of miniatures from one player to the next. The rules allow for the use of a deck of 52 Game Cards that add an exciting element of randomness to each game. You can play without them, but they improve the overall game play and inject some additional eccentric Victorian atmosphere.&#10;&#10;Dystopian Wars is our third game to be built using our D6-based core rules engine and shares elements with the science fiction space combat of Firestorm Armada and the fantasy naval combat of the Uncharted Seas. Dystopian Wars builds on the same successful game ethos.&#10;&#10;We are excited about the development of Dystopian Wars - it is an entertaining and violent game, putting you in command of huge Land Vessels, Giant Robots, Impressive Airships and Rugged Naval Ships. Your strategies and choices of fleet construction determine the margin of your victories or defeat. Whether you choose to focus on land, sea or in the air, you have every choice available to you to outmanoeuvre, harass and destroy your opponent.&#10;&#10;You command one of the great imperial powers of Dystopian Wars, you can defend your territories from foreign incursion, or you can conquer the world. The choice is yours.&#10;&#10;";Miniatures,Nautical,Post-Napoleonic,Science Fiction,Wargame,World War I;2010
Name 5;"Can you name the five Great Lakes in 30 seconds?  Sure, but can you name five things you shouldn't say to your boss?  That's the idea behind this quick-thinking team trivia game.  When it's your team's turn, roll the die and move your pawn that many spaces.  You'll then draw a card and you and your teammates will try to name 5 things that fit a category within 30 seconds.  If you can, you get another turn.  If not, it'll be your opponents' turn.&#10;&#10;Most of the spaces on the board are solid colors, which determine what category is in play.  For example, if you land on a red space, you play the red category.  However, there are four kinds of special spaces:  All Play (both teams get a different category, and the first team to name 5 things in their category rolls the die and takes the next turn), Flip Flop (teams alternate giving answers until someone can't think of another), Wild (your team gets their choice of the five categories on the card) and Double Down (you have to pick two of the 5 categories and name five things in both those categories, all in 30 seconds).&#10;&#10;When you reach the big Name 5 space in the center of the board (which you have to do by exact count), you'll have the chance to win the game.  You and your team will have 90 seconds to name 5 things in each of the 5 categories on the card.&#10;&#10;";Trivia;2009

Fuentes de Onoro 1811;"Fuentes de Onoro 1811 focus on the last events of the fight between Mass&eacute;na and Wellington in Portugal and Spain. It includes three battles: Foz do Arouce, Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro and El Bodon 1811 which are thus be the 32nd, 33rd and 34th battles of the series.&#10;&#10;The game is also the 6th entry in the Vae Victis Wargame Collection. The main battle, Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro, has an A2 map and the two smaller ones have A3 maps. The game include 216 counters and markers.&#10;&#10;Foz do Arouce, 15th March 1811&#10;The fight took place just after Redhina and Casal Novo but before Sabugal and Fuentes de Onoro, as Wellington followed Massena out of the lines of Torres Vedras. It included two popular British divisions, the 3rd and the Light. The French under Ney held a ridge with a river behind it that was crossed by a single bridge. The French ridge on their left was much higher than the one on the right. In the centre there was a gap of about 200 yards, occupied by the village of Foz d'Arouce. Some companies of the 95th rifles penetrated down a hollow road there, almost unopposed, quite close to the bridge. The rest of the Light division held Marchand in a frontal fight on the French right. Half of Mermet&rsquo;s division on the French left faced the 3rd Division. The 39th lost its eagle in the river as they tried to cross a deep ford below the bridge, and many men were drowned.&#10;&#10;Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro, 3rd to 5th May 1811&#10;On the 3rd of May, Mass&eacute;na launched a frontal assault against the British-Portuguese pickets holding the barricaded village, while subjecting the British-Portuguese on the heights east of the village to a heavy artillery bombardment. The village was the centre of the fighting for the whole day, with French soldiers of Ferey's and Marchand's divisions clashing with the British redcoats of the 1st and 3rd Divisions. May 4 saw little combat. Both sides recovered from the ferocity of the previous day of fighting and reconsidered their options and battle plans. A French reconnaissance revealed that Wellington's right flank was weakly held by a unit of partisans near the hamlet of Pozo Bello. Action began again at dawn on the 5th of May. Wellington had left the 7th Division exposed on his right flank. Mass&eacute;na launched a heavy attack on the weak British-Portuguese flank, led by Montbrun's dragoons and supported by the infantry divisions of Marchand, Mermet and Solignac. Right away, two 7th Division battalions were roughed up by French light cavalry. This compelled Wellington to send reinforcements to save the 7th Division from annihilation. This was only achieved by the efforts of the Light Division and the British and King's German Legion cavalry. In response, Wellington counterattacked with units from the 1st and 3rd Divisions, plus the Portuguese 6th Ca&ccedil;adores. Led by the 88th Connaught Rangers Foot, this effort broke Drouet's attack and the tide began to turn. Low on ammunition, the French had to resort to the bayonet in a futile attempt to drive the British back. Drouet launched a second attack on the town. This time it was led by three battalions of converged grenadiers from IX Corps. With their old-fashioned bearskin hats, the grenadiers were mistaken for the Imperial Guard. Again, the British fell back. Drouet threw in about half of the battalions from both Conroux and Clapar&egrave;de's divisions, seizing almost the entire town. The French artillery tried to bombard the new British line into submission, but they were outgunned by Wellington's cannon. Finally, with their artillery ammunition dangerously low, the French attacks came to an end. Wellington's men entrenched during the evening.&#10;&#10;El Bodon 25th September 1811&#10;The fight included a French cavalry force of 2500, against a mixed force of Picton&rsquo;s 3rd Division consisting of 1000 men, 500 cavalry and two Portuguese batteries. The French attacked in 3 columns of cavalry with a 4th column in reserve, &quot;since only parts of the hillside were open ground suitable for cavalry.&quot; The attack fell upon the isolated part of Wallace&rsquo;s Brigade covering the road. As the French columns came up the slope they were attacked by Alten&rsquo;s light cavalry one squadron at a time &quot;with the slope in their favour.&rdquo; The individual squadrons then rallied behind their supports. The British had to hold on, to allow time for the widely separated parts of 3rd Division to retire.&#10;&#10;Fuentes de Onoro 1811 includes:&#10;&#10;    A 59 x 40 cm map,&#10;    216 double-sided die-cut counters and markers,&#10;    A color rulebook with scenarios and a player aid.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Units : Regiments and brigades&#10;Map scale : 500 m/hex.&#10;Turn : 120 minutes&#10;&#10;Complexity : 6 / 9&#10;&#10;Bilingual Rules and Charts (English/French).&#10;&#10;";Napoleonic,Wargame;2011
Next War: Taiwan;"Over sixty years later, and the divisions still run deeper than the straits which separate the Republic of China from the People's Republic of China. Once again, a historically, ethnically, and culturally homogeneous people separated by politics and economics hurl men, weapons, and material into the maelstrom of modern combat in an attempt to settle their bitter division once and for all.&#10;&#10;Next War: Taiwan, the next volume in GMT's series of Next War games and the follow-on to Next War: Korea, allows players to fight a near future war in and around the island of Taiwan. In this sequel, the communist state of China, the PRC, has decided that its time to end the rhetoric and posturing and bring the breakaway republic back into the Socialist Harmonious Society.&#10;&#10;Due to the nature of the &quot;terrain&quot; surrounding Taiwan, the game features an expanded, yet still abstracted and playable, naval system including submarine threats, ASW, mine warfare, and anti-naval strikes. In addition, rules exist for combining Next War: Taiwan with Next War: Korea to simulate an expanded conflict.&#10;&#10;Note: the Next War series is not an Introductory wargame. Rather, we have intended herein to create a system (and a series) that will allow detailed study of modern warfare in various venues as well as engaging gameplay. That said, the Standard Game rules encompass a fairly straightforward ruleset that will, we think, be considered pretty &quot;easy to learn&quot; by experienced wargamers. So players who choose to play Standard Game scenarios can have a relatively quick game when that's what suits them. The real flavor of a war in the theatre, though, comes through in the Advanced Game, where you get much more control over airpower and can more clearly see each side's strengths and weaknesses. For players who want a &quot;mini-monster game&quot; experience, playing the Advanced Game Campaign Scenarios with some or all of the optional rules will definitely &quot;deliver.&quot;&#10;&#10;Ownership of Next War: Korea will NOT be required to play.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Units&#10;&#10;Ground units in Next War: Taiwan represent primarily brigades, regiments, and battalions of the armies of the two Chinas and the United States. All ground units are rated for their attack and defense strengths, movement capabilities, and unit efficiency.&#10;&#10;Air units represent fighter, bomber, and attack squadrons of the major combatants and are rated for All-Weather Capabilities as well as their range, average pilot skill, and their abilities in Air-to-Air Combat, Close Air Support, and Strike missions.&#10;&#10;Naval units and capabilities are abstracted somewhat in the Next War series. A &quot;Sea Control&quot; mechanism reflects the results of the surface and sub-surface battles, while the game's naval unit counters represent the major Aircraft Carrier Battle Groups and Amphibious Ready Groups of the US Navy. Additional amphibious capabilities are represented by the Special Forces capabilities of each side. Changes to the naval system include&#10;&#10;     Naval Display Play Aid to allow for movement, air ranges, etc. in the seas surrounding Taiwan&#10;     a Submarine Threat Level and ASW Level matrix for the PRC and Allies respectively to represent the subsurface conflict&#10;     naval mine warfare allowing either side to attempt to deny usage of Beaches for Amphibious Assaults or Ports and Beachheads for Sea Transport&#10;     anti-Naval Strikes (including Cruise Missiles) allowing each side to force enemy Naval units to withdraw or risk losses&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Maps and Terrain&#10;&#10;The game's map presents the island of modern-day Taiwan at a scale of roughly 7.5 miles per hex. The map covers the entire island and includes several holding boxes and tracking displays.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Game System&#10;&#10;A game turn is generally composed of:&#10;&#10;Weather Determination. Bad weather can severely hamper air and naval operations activity and can significantly slow ground operations.&#10;&#10;Initiative Determination and Air/Naval Phase, wherein Air Superiority levels and air availability are determined and Sea Control is established or modified.&#10;&#10;Special Operations Phases in the Advanced Game allowing players to utilize their special operators in various recon and raid missions behind enemy lines.&#10;&#10;Strike Phases in the Advanced Game allowing players to launch air strikes, cruise missiles, and artillery and SSM strikes.&#10;&#10;One or more Movement and Combat Phases that allow both sides to move, react, and fight, with an advantage to the Initiative player on non-Contested turns&#10;&#10;Arrival of Reinforcements and Replacements&#10;Victory Determination&#10;&#10;Combat resolution examines not only unit strengths but also unit efficiency (representing training, doctrine, and morale), as well as the terrain where the combat takes place. The CRT tends to be very bloody in nature, reflecting what we believe will be a degree of attritional warfare early due to the lethality of modern weapons. As in many games, casualties represent not only actual combat losses but also losses of unit cohesion brought about by the rapid pace with which modern armies are able to engage and exploit on the battlefield.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Scenarios&#10;&#10;There are several Standard Game scenarios. The first three are small and cover the first weeks of the war by dividing the island into roughly three equal sections. These focus on the initial assaults by the PRC to establish beachheads and take Ports and introduce players to the basic mechanics of the system, while giving them insight into attack and defense strategies for the &quot;big game.&quot; Players can also play the entire Campaign Game which uses the entire map and all of the Standard Game rules. One other scenario is provided which examines a theoretical U.S. Amphibious landing in an attempt to take back the island.&#10;&#10;The Advanced Game Scenarios come in three flavors &agrave; la NATO: The Next War in Europe: Strategic Surprise, Tactical Surprise, and Extended Buildup. This offers the players the ability to game out a variety of &quot;At Start&quot; war scenarios based on varying levels of readiness.&#10;&#10;There is also an International Posture Matrix &agrave; la Flashpoint: Golan to allow players to experiment with a variety of intervention options for the non-Chinese players in the region.&#10;&#10;In addition, there is a full set of rules covering how to play a combined Next War: Taiwan/Korea game.&#10;&#10;In Next War: Taiwan, the Taiwan Straits are on fire with the Goliath of the PRC arrayed against the David of the ROC. Can you, as the People's Liberation Army/Naval commander, conquer the separatist rebels in four weeks before the full might of the U.S. can be brought to bear? Can you, as the Republic of China's Army commander, hold out against the renewed Communist assault until help arrives? And what will happen in Korea while all this is going on?

Robotech RPG Tactics;"Prepare for invasion! Robotech RPG Tactics is a tactical miniatures game set in the Robotech universe. While the 1/285th scale game pieces can be used as a companion to the Robotech RPG, the game system is designed to be played as a tabletop miniatures game. Players build armies of multiple squadrons of mecha to fight it out in scenario-driven, objective-based game play. Take command of the fighting forces of the United Earth Defense Force (UEDF) valiantly defending Earth from alien annihilation &ndash; or lead the massive clone armies of the Zentraedi Armada to recover an alien artifact of immense power and enslave humankind. Depending on the faction, and their choice of mecha, a player's army may include anywhere from two game pieces to as many as you desire! The rules are scalable from small skirmishes to mass combat with hundreds per side.&#10;&#10;Robotech RPG Tactics uses a dynamic turn system. Players trade off activating squadrons during each turn, ensuring that a player never has to sit and wait while his opponent moves and attacks with his entire army. By using alternating activation of squadrons, the game's action unfolds at a fast and furious pace, allowing large scale battles to be easily carried out in a single evening. Each player receives a number of Command Points each turn based on the number of mecha they have on the field, and the quality of their officers. Command Points are spent throughout the turn on maneuvers such as boosted movement, devastating weapon salvos, breakneck dodging counterattacks, and potent special abilities.&#10;&#10;The wide variety of mecha in the boxed game bring to bear the myriad and awesome weapon systems from the Robotech universe to lay waste to your foes. Even the battlefield itself can alter over the course of the game as buildings are leveled by destruction unleashed during the battle.&#10;&#10;";Aviation / Flight,Miniatures,Movies / TV / Radio theme,Science Fiction,Space Exploration;2014

MBT (second edition);"From GMT P500:&#10;&#10;MBT is a complete game system modeling the US 7th Army and the GSFG Soviet mechanized forces of 1987.  It is M1 Abrams (105mm and 120mm armed version)versus a whole stable of Soviet armor with their T-80s, T-72s, T-64s, and upgraded models of T-62 and T-55.  There is even M60A3s sprinkled in to balance out the US tank inventory. Bradley IFVs and CFVs mechanized units are set to take on their counterparts mounted in BMP 1,2s and even a few 3s.  Not to overlooked M113A2s and BTRs and MT-LBs are also set to make their appearance.&#10;&#10;Mechanized infantry and their related weapons are in abundance, including M47 Dragon, M72 LAW, AT-7 Saxon, AT-4 Spigot, and multiple RPG versions.&#10;&#10;The scale is right down in the weeds with individual vehicles, infantry squads, half squads and sections.  Each hex is just 100 meters across, so it is going to be nose-to-nose action at its finest.&#10;&#10;The rules cover the total realm of modern mechanized combat with ATGMs, including TOW and deadly Soviet gun launched missiles like the AT-11 Sniper and AT-8 Songster, special armor (including ERA), advanced night fighting with thermal images and image intensifiers, advance artillery with ICM and laser guided shells, helicopters, including the AH-64A Apache and Mi-24P Hind-F, attack aircraft, including the A-10A Warthog and SU-25 Frogfoot, and missile and gun armed AA units to counter the deadly air threats.

Beyond the Rhine;"Beyond the Rhine: The Campaign for Northwest Europe, September 1944 - April 1945, begins with the German Army reeling from a string of near-fatal defeats, and in full retreat to the safety of the West Wall where it hopes to make a stand. The Allies, flush with victory, believe one more push will bring them home for Christmas.&#10;&#10;The expected walk-over was not to be, and players will find either army a challenge to command. Allied material superiority is (mostly) balanced by German tenacity, rugged terrain, and lousy weather. Defensive-minded players will be happiest playing the Germans, but players of all temperaments will discover that there is still plenty of torque left in the Axis even at this late stage of the war. The Allies will not cross the Rhine without a tough fight!&#10;&#10;Beyond the Rhine is a big game, with 3.5-mile hexes, 3.5-day turns, and counters for units from battalions up to divisions. At this scale the various Western Front battles&mdash;Market-Garden, H&uuml;rtgen, Bulge, Nordwind, Remagen, etc.&mdash;have an operational ebb and flow, but can also be viewed in relation to the whole front. A comprehensive game like this one, covering the entire Western Front, was long overdue.&#10;&#10;Special rules in this 14th game of the Operational Combat Series have been carefully designed to recreate this fascinating campaign. They include:&#10;&#10;Random events similar to what are found in the award-winning DAK. These cover things like Fuel Shortages, Arty Ammo Stockpiles, Lost Couriers, Railway Strikes, and Dambuster Raids. The 58 possible events add a lot of historical flavor but require very little rules overhead.&#10;The importance and difficulty of the Rhine crossings are distilled into rules allowing the bridges to be blown and repaired, and pontoons to be emplaced.&#10;Background effects of Allied air interdiction are simple and elegant (built into the Terrain Effects Chart and Weather), but the player does have the option to switch some of these planes to normal barrages and sweeps.&#10;The strategic significance of the Ruhr and the Saar, of clearing the left bank of the Rhine, and of major ports such as Antwerp are reflected by simple economic effects and the game&rsquo;s &ldquo;Broadfront&rdquo; restrictions on US supply placement and usage.&#10;The Wacht am Rhein counter-offensive is recreated by simple mechanics for off-map buildup and operational surprise.&#10;Many options are included for players wanting even more realism. For instance, there are rules for German Kampfgruppen and extra restrictions on the plethora of Allied independent units.&#10;Beyond the Rhine features three monster-sized campaigns that use a 44x66-inch map layout and over 1,000 combat units. Also included are several smaller scenarios, including a 9-turn Bulge game played on a special map (otherwise, portions of all four maps would be needed).&#10;&#10;Grand Campaign: 4 maps, 70 turns&#10;Fall of &lsquo;44 (Montgomery): 2 maps, 26 turns&#10;Fall of &lsquo;44 (Bradley): 2 maps, 26 turns&#10;Operation Queen: 1 map, 9 turns&#10;Bulge Campaign: 4 maps, 40 turns&#10;A Time for Trumpets: 1 map, 9 turns&#10;Nordwind: 1 map, 13 turns&#10;Endkampf Campaign: 4 maps, 24 turns&#10;Spring of &lsquo;45 (Montgomery): 2 maps, 24 turns&#10;Spring of &lsquo;45 (Bradley): 2 maps, 24 turns.&#10;&#10;Game Scale:&#10;Turn: 1/2 Week&#10;Hex: 3.5 miles / 5.6 Km &#10;Units: Company to Corps&#10;&#10;Game Inventory:&#10;Five 22&quot; X 34&quot; mapsheets&#10;Eight countersheets (2,240 1/2&quot; dual-side printed counters)&#10;One 48 page OCS rules booklet&#10;One 64 page Beyond the Rhine game rules booklet&#10;Two 4 page OCS Charts &amp; Tables folders&#10;Two 8 page Beyond the Rhine Charts &amp; Tables folders (one each for Allied &amp; Axis)&#10;Three Player Aid Cards (1 sided)&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;";Wargame,World War II;2015

Battle for Sularia;"Welcome Battle Commanders! The future of your faction's survival is depending on you! Gain influence and expand your forces to strategically defeat the opposing faction. You win the battle when you reduce your opponent&rsquo;s health to zero. However, a Battle Commander must be cautious if their opponent is off-initiative. Since Battle for Sularia is a round-based card game, if your opponent is off-initiative, they have the chance to strike back and reduce your health total below theirs and thereby defeating you and winning the game!&#10;&#10;FEATURES INCLUDE:&#10;&#10;Multiple Play Modes&#10;With one box, you and your friend can play with the preconstructed 60 card play decks in a head-to-head 2 player game. The two players can then play in our &quot;60/90&quot; constructed format by customizing their play decks with the additional 60 cards provided in the box! If draft play is more your style, one box also supports 2-4 player draft play! An 8 player draft simply requires one additional box. Of course, the game is fully expandable for a variety of casual play modes &ndash; one box supports up to 2 players in casual mode, but there is simply no limit on how many players and formats are available with additional boxes.&#10;&#10;Construction Point Values&#10;Unique &quot;60/90&quot; deck construction system. Each card has a construction point value of 1 to 4 points. Each deck must have a minimum of 60 cards and a deck cannot exceed a total construction value of 90 points. This system pushes the envelope on deck construction and maintains value and interests for all cards within the set &ndash; not just a few select overpowered options.&#10;&#10;Two-resource System&#10;Engaging two-resource system which includes influence and sularium. Influence increases once per round, while each player uses their influence to establish sites on their turn to help build their sularium stockpiles. Sularium is used to deploy combatants, which are used to attack your opponent's sites. The two-resource system in turn provides additional strategies for repeatable game play.&#10;&#10;Round-based Game&#10;Simultaneous combat! The game runs on a round-based system, which allows each player to complete their turn before the round is over.&#10;&#10;Lore and Art&#10;In addition to our engaging game play, we've forged our own path in terms of game setting.
